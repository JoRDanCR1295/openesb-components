<a name=UpgradeFrom5x></a><b>Upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2 from TeamTrack 5.x or Earlier</b></p>
	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR> 
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine 
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit 
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly. 
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine 
portion of your browser. 
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer): 
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on 
and off. 
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options. 
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support. 
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in. 
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event 
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does 
not allow you to run Java Applets: 
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

<P><A name=InitExtension><B>Resolving InitExtension Failed Errors by Correcting the IUSR_ Account Privileges
</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.

Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):

TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

<a name=UpgradeFrom5x></a><b>Upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2 from TeamTrack 5.x or Earlier</b></p>
	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories.

<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.

Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on

TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories.

<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.

Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.

<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on

TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

<a name=UpgradeFrom5x></a><b>Upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2 from TeamTrack 5.x or Earlier</b></p>
	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.

Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):

<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on

<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.

TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.

TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

<a name=UpgradeFrom5x></a><b>Upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2 from TeamTrack 5.x or Earlier</b></p>
	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

<a name=UpgradeFrom5x></a><b>Upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2 from TeamTrack 5.x or Earlier</b></p>
	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories.

<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.

TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

<a name=UpgradeFrom5x></a><b>Upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2 from TeamTrack 5.x or Earlier</b></p>
	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<P>
	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.

Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on

TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	The following information is provided to assist you in planning your upgrade to TeamTrack 6.2 from a 5.x or earlier version. <P>
	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.

TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.

	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings. If you select the option to re-install TeamTrack, you can change the directory in which TeamTrack is installed, your IIS virtual directory settings, etc. <!--PRB03690-->
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 5.51, the default location of the file attachment directory was changed from "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\bin\attachments" to "...\TeamShare\TeamTrack\attachments". If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51 and your current attachment directory is beneath the bin directory, it will be moved to the TeamTrack directory. If the TeamTrack installer is unable to move your attachments directory, refer to the "Upgrading Attachments in 5.51" article in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.<!--CHG002249-->
	<P>
	<LI>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than TeamTrack 5.51, part of this upgrade is performed by the Notification Server itself. If your Notification Server is installed on a separate machine, you must start the Notification Server on that machine before starting it from another server.   <!--PRB02098-->

</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.

	<OL>
	<LI>The TeamTrack 6.x upgrade from a 5.x earlier version of TeamTrack requires that you enter replacement license codes for your system's Named and Concurrent user and external, Managed Administrator, and API/Script licenses. Serena Software strongly recommends you obtain replacement codes before installing this upgrade. <!--BUG02500-->In addition, to avoid losing user preference and privilege settings, do not edit existing user accounts until you add your new license codes. To receive new codes, contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>A TeamTrack Server license is required for each Web server used by TeamTrack. When you upgrade to TeamTrack 6.x from a 5.x or earlier version of TeamTrack, a 30-day server license is added to TeamTrack. You must contact Serena Software with a TeamTrack-provided Hardware ID before this license expires to receive a valid server license. Before contacting Serena Software, launch the TeamTrack Administrator on each Web server, select the Licenses tab, and then click the Options button. The Hardware ID for the server is available on the page. Contact Serena Software by e-mail at <a href="mailto:order@serena.com">order@serena.com</A>; within the U.S., call 877-696-1850, option 6; outside the U.S, call 650-522-6600, option 6.
	<P>
	<LI>Because of significant changes to the TeamTrack user interface, all browser templates were modified in TeamTrack 6.1. If you are upgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version of TeamTrack and have customized your TeamTrack browser templates, refer to the following articles in the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site before upgrading to TeamTrack 6.2:<p>
	- &quot;Handling Customized Templates on Upgrade&quot; <BR>
	- &quot;Changes to TeamTrack CSS Styles in TeamTrack 5.7&quot;<BR>
	- &quot;Customized Character Sets and Upgrading to TeamTrack 5.7 and Higher&quot;
	<P>
	<LI>In TeamTrack 6.1, the help system for the browser interface migrated to a cross-platform, cross-browser system that allows for easier navigation and searching. If you are updgrading from a 5.x or 4.x version to TeamTrack 6.2, files for the old help system are stored in the Serena/TeamTrack/bin/help/backup directory. You can access these files as needed for customizing the files included in the new help system. Please note, however, that much of the content in the new help system has been modified to address new functionality and navigation, so the information in the old files is outdated. For instructions on customizing browser online help files for TeamTrack 6.2, refer to the Serena TeamTrack Administrator Guide.
	<P>
	<LI> Beginning with TeamTrack 5.7, ISO-8859-1 (Western European) is the default browser character set for upgraded databases. If you have customized browser templates to specify a default character set other than ISO-8859-1, you must specify this character set on the Database tab of the Settings dialog after you upgrade to TeamTrack 5.7 or later. To prevent data from displaying incorrectly, you MUST specify this character set before going live with your upgrade. To use Unicode (UTF-8) with TeamTrack 5.7 or later, you must convert existing high-bit (Western European) data using a TeamTrack-provided tool. For details, contact Technical Support or refer to the Solutions area of the Serena eSupport site.
	<P>
	<LI>If you have changed your browser character set to Western European and you are upgrading from a 5.x version or earlier, the TeamTrack 6.2 upgrade will change this setting to ISO-8859-1. <!--BUG05209-->
	<P>
    <LI>In version 6.1, the installer was enhanced so that it remembers the type of installation you performed on the machine you are upgrading. For example, if you did a complete installation on a machine for a previous version of TeamTrack, the installer automatically provides a complete installation when upgrading. If you only installed the Administrator and/or notification server components during a previous version, the installer selects these options by default during the upgrade, but allows you to install a complete version on the machine if necessary. In addition, if during the installation process for an upgrade you select the option to upgrade your system, you can no longer change any settings.

<P><A name=InitExtension><B>Resolving InitExtension Failed Errors by Correcting the IUSR_ Account Privileges
</B></A></P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) uses an account, IUSR_machinename (Internet Guest Account), to access the TeamTrack database when the Web server is running on Windows 2000 or Windows NT. If you are experiencing InitExtension Failed errors while trying to login to the TeamTrack browser interface while using the Microsoft Access, you may need to set correct privileges for the IUSR accounts. For TeamTrack to function correctly, this IUSR_ account needs Full Control over TeamTrack directories. Also, the IUSR_ account needs to have Read and Execute permissions in the WINNT and WINNT\system32 directories. The following instructions explain how to change NTFS permissions on Windows 2000 or NT servers.

<!--***END VIRTUAL DIRECTORY SECTION ******************************************************************************-->
<HR align=center width="100%" SIZE=2>
<P><A name=JVM><B>Resolving Java Virtual Machine Problems</B></A></P>
Some TeamTrack features are Java Applets and as such, rely on an end-user operating system component or browser plug-in called the java virtual machine (JVM). The virtual machine
interprets the java applet and runs it on your machine. In TeamTrack, the Folders view and Submit
tree are java applets and require a functioning java virtual machine to run properly.
<P>
Problems caused by incorrect JVM settings:
<UL>
<LI>Folder/Submit panes fail to load.
<LI>Incorrect folders display when logging in as a different user.
<LI>Broken Image Icon (red X) displays in folder panes.
<LI>Clicking Save Profile does not save the folder profile.
<LI>Folder/Submit trees functions erratically.
</LI>
</UL>
Suggested Fixes for Microsoft's Virtual Machine (Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and verify that the JIT Compiler is enabled in the Microsoft VM section.
<LI>Run a Windows Update from within your browser and upgrade/re-install the Java Virtual Machine
portion of your browser.
</LI>
</OL>
Suggested Fixes for Sun's Virtual Machine (Netscape and Internet Explorer):
<OL>
<LI>In Netscape, open the Java Plug-in Control Panel and in the Browser section, toggle APPLET SUPPORT on
and off.
<LI>In Internet Explorer, select Tools from the menu, and then select Internet Options.
<LI>Select the Advanced tab, and then enable Java Applet Tag Support.
<LI>Re-install Java's Virtual Machine plug-in.
</LI>
</OL>
TeamTrack Workarounds
<P>
There are also a couple of workarounds to JVM problems within TeamTrack. Use these in the event
that you are unable to load or configure a working version of a VM or if your firewall/proxy does
not allow you to run Java Applets:
<P>
<OL><LI>In each TeamTrack user's profile, select the Suppress Java check box. This makes the folder/submit panes use HTML rather than Java Applets.
<LI>Use Cookie Authentication which enables Netscape browsers to correctly authenticate the folder panes. Authentication settings are located on the Server tab of the Settings dialog in the TeamTrack Administrator.
