# Description
# This test distributes the messages to two different engines. i.e the Input1 is sent to ParentProcess1 running in engine1
# and Input2 meant for ParentProcess2 is sent to engine2

engine1.messages=Input1
engine2.messages=Input2

# Define the message to engine mapping here
expectedCompleteInstances=3

# Define the engines crash info
engine1.crash=false
engine2.crash=false

# the durtaiton after which this engine would shutdown, regardless of the fact the messages
# were processed or not. This is to simulate engine crash. Time duration in seconds
engine1.runDuration=20
engine2.runDuration=20
