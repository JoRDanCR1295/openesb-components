<A NAME="camserviceenginestats"></A><h3>Viewing Service
Engine Statistics</h3>
<p>For each service engine, you can view such information as message throughput
and whether any errors have occurred.</p>
<p>Be sure to work with members of the application team to understand what
constitutes normal behavior for the application.</p>
<p>The Composite Application Manager provides two views of the statistics:</p>
<ul><li><p>The tabular view shows the information in a table.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The graphical view shows the information in charts. You can
select the type of chart, add a three-dimensional effect, and switch between
horizontal and vertical orientation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The statistics are divided into web service endpoints that provide a
service and web service endpoints that consume a service.</p>
<p>You can see how many requests have been received and sent, and how many
errors occurred.</p>
<p>To display service engine statistics</p>
<ol><li><p><b>In the left pane, select a service engine.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>In the right pane, click the Statistics tab.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>To switch between the views, click Show Graphical View and Show
Tabular View.</b></p></li>
</ol>
