<A NAME="camjbiconcepts"></A><h3>Java Business Integration
(JBI) Concepts</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-1"></A>JavaBusiness Integration (JBI) seeks to
create a standards-based architecture for integration solutions.</p>
<p>The JBI specification defines two types of components.</p>
<ul><li><p>Service engines provide services to other components.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Binding components provide connectivity to services external
to a JBI installation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>JBI components can function as service providers, service consumers,
or both.</p>
<p>JBI components do not interact with each other directly. Instead, the
JBI environment functions as an intermediary to route messages from component
to component.</p>
<p>A service unit is a deployment artifact that is destined for a single
JBI component. A service assembly is a collection of service units. During
the deployment process, the service units are deployed to the appropriate
service engines and binding components.</p>
