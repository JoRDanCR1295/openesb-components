Assembly Statistics and Status</h3>
<p>In the graphical view of a service assembly, each box represents a service
unit that has been deployed to a service engine or binding component.</p>
<ul><li><p>If the box is white, then the service unit is started.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the box is light gray, then the service unit is stopped.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the box is dark, then the service unit is shut down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The color of the connection link indicates the type of connection.</p>
<ul><li><p>If the connection link is purple, then the connection is from
a binding component to a service engine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the connection link is green, then the connection is from
a service engine to a binding component.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the connection link is red, then the connection is from
a service engine to another service engine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the connection link is blue, then the connection is from
a binding component to another binding component.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To view connection information</p>
<ol><li><p><b>In the left pane, select a service assembly.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>In the right pane, place the pointer on a connection.</b></p></li>
