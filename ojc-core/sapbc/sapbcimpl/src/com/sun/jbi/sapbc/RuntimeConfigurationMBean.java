     *to provide validation of the values being changed, values that are secret like passwords not shown, detailed descriptions 
     *of configuration fields, and descriptive displays of configuration parameter labels. Since this information cannot be 
     *obtained in a detailed fashion from Standard MBeans that may be used to create the Configuration MBeans, it is possible 
     *to provide these details in other ways that can be used by the UI to create appropriate renderers and Validators. 
     *If component developers want to leverage these features, here is what needs to be done.
     *The component developer has to provide a schema corresponding to the attributes that are available in their 
     *Configuration MBean, and xml data that correspond to detailed descriptions of the attributes. Based on this, the UI 
     *can create appropriate renderers and Validators.

     * positive integers, specify totalDigits, and minInclusive or maxExclusive ï¿½ in effect any definition that can
