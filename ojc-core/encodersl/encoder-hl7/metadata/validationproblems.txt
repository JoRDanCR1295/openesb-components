--> xsdbuilder tool is including the information in XSDs about HL7 Organization withdrawn datatypes, fields, and data structure, which are represented by "-" in HL7 DB. 
The XSDs should not contain references to these withdrawn elements. Corrected the XSDs by removing the occurances of  these elements otherwise XSDs won't get validated. 

withdrawn fields:

DG1.2,DG1.4,DG1.14, FT1.8, FT1.9, IN1.38, IN1.140, IN1.41, MSA.5, PR1.2, PR1.4, PR1.8, PR1.11,PR1.12, UB1.2
