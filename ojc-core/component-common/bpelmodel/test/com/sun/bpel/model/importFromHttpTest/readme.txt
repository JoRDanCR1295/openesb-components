This test is designed to test downloading an XSD from a URL.  It is for testing an issue (107908) reported in netbeans issuezilla (http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=107908).

In NewWebServiceService.wsdl, the locations for imported XSDs are HTTP URLs, something like "http://localhost:13283/TestJavaWebservicec/NewWebServiceService?xsd=1".
