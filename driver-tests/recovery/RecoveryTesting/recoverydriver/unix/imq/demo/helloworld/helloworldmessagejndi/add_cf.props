# This imqobjmgr command file can be used to add a ConnectionFactory 
# object where
#     JNDI lookup name = MyConnectionFactory
#     Provider URL = C:/Temp on windows or /tmp on Unix
#     (the relevant lines need to be commented/uncommented)
#
# This command file is used by running:
#  imqobjmgr -i <command file>
#
# The more verbose imqobjmgr command that performs the equivalent
# action is:
#  imqobjmgr add
#	-t cf
#	-l "MyConnectionFactory" 
#	-j java.naming.provider.url=file:///Temp
#	-j java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory
#

#
# Object attributes
#  - None specified since we will use the default settings
#    (host is localhost, port is 7676)
#
# Here is an example of how this can be configured to use an MQ
# broker on host foo, port 7878:
#obj.attrs.imqAddressList=mq://foo:7878/jms

#
# Object store attributes:
# JNDI initial factory
#
objstore.attrs.java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory
#
# JNDI provider URL
# For Windows systems
objstore.attrs.java.naming.provider.url=file:///C:/Temp
