  Client Identification</H2>
 
<P>Use this tab to re-specify default values of user name and password and to 
  re-specify how a client will be identified (ClientID) to a broker. ClientId 
  values are used mainly to keep track of durable subscribers.</P>

<p><b>Default Username</b> Specifies the default user name that will be used to 
  authenticate with the broker. The default value is <code>guest</code>.</p>

<p><b>Default Password</b> Specifies the default password that will be used to 
  authenticate with the broker. The default value is <code>guest</code>.</p>

<p><b>Disable setClientID() JMS API </b>Specifies that client application is prevented 
  from using API calls to change ClientID. It is generally better for you, the 
  administrator, to control the assignment of ClientIDs.</p>

<p> If you check the box, you can use the <b>Configure ClientID as</b> field to 
  specify a ClientID for the client. If you don't specify such a value, a default 
  value consisting of the client' host's IP address is assigned by the system. 
  While this is done as a convenience for developers, it prohibits a client application 
  from creating more than one connection: the system does not allow two connections 
  with the same ClientID.</p>

<p><b>Configure ClientID as</b> Specifies an identifier for the client. If you 
  don't specify this value and you have disabled the api call that sets the ClientID, 
  a default value consisting of the client host's IP address is assigned by the 
  system. While this is done as a convenience for developers, it prohibits a client 
  application from creating more than one connection: the system does not allow 
  two connections with the same ClientID.</p>
