 <H2>Add Broker Destination</H2>

<P>Use this dialog to create and configure a physical destination on a broker. 
  The <i>destination</i> on the broker is a location in the broker's physical 
  memory where incoming messages are marshalled before being routed to message 
  consumers. </P>
<P>Message Queue messaging is implemented as a two-phase delivery of messages: first the 
  message is delivered from a producer to a <i>destination</i> on the broker; 
  second, the message is delivered from the destination on the broker to one or 
  more consumers. </P>
<P>A broker can be configured to dynamically create physical destinations if you 
  have not created them. These autocreated destinations are automatically destroyed 
  by the broker when they are no longer needed.</P>
<P>To configure a physical destination, set the following attribute values:</P>
<P><b>Destination Name</b> Specifies the name of the physical destination.</P>
<P><b>Destination Type</b> Specifies the destination type (queue or topic). Click 
  the <b>Queue</b> or <b>Topic</b> radio button. </P>

<P><b>Max Number of Messages</b> Specifies the maximum number of unconsumed messages 
  allowed in this destination. </P>
<p><b>Max Total Message Bytes </b> Specifies the maximum total amount of memory 
  allowed for unconsumed messages in this destination. Use the drop down list 
  to select the unit of measurement: bytes, kbytes, or megabytes.</p>
<p><b>Max Bytes per Message</b> Specifies the maximum size of any single message 
  allowed in this destination. Use the drop down list to select the unit of measurement: 
  bytes, kbytes, or megabytes.</p>
<p><b>Max Number of Producers</b> Specifies the maximum number of producers allowed 
  for this destination.</p>
<p><b>Max Number of Active Consumers </b> Applies to queue destinations only. 
  Specifies the maximum number of consumers that can be active in load-balanced 
  delivery from this destination.</p>
<p><b>Max Number of Backup Consumers </b> Applies to queue destinations only. 
  Specifies the maximum number of backup consumers that can take the place of 
  active consumers, should any active consumers fail during load-balanced delivery 
  from this destination.</p>
