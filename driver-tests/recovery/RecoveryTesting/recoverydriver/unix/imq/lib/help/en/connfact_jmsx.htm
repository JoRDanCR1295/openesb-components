<H2>Connection Factory Object Properties &gt; <BR>JMSX Properties</H2>
 
<P>Use this tab to re-specify which JMS-defined properties should be set by Message Queue.</P>

<p>Message Queue supports a number of JMS-defined attributes, though at the cost of resources. 
  To conserve resources, you should determine which of these properties are actually 
  needed by the client application and enable setting of those properties by clicking 
  the appropriate checkbox.</p>
<p><b>Enable JMSXAppID Message Property</b> Specifies whether Message Queue should set the 
  JMS-defined property, JMSXAppID (identity of application sending the message), 
  on produced messages. Default: false</p>
<p><b>Enable JMSXUserID Message Property</b> Specifies whether Message Queue should set the 
  JMS-defined property, JMSXUserID (identity of user sending the message), on 
  produced messages. Default: false</p>
<p><b>Enable JMSXProducerTXID Message Property</b> Specifies whether Message Queue should 
  set the JMS-defined property, JMSXProducerTXID (transaction identifier of the 
  transaction within which this message was produced), on produced messages. Default: 
  false</p>
<p><b>Enable JMSXConsumerTXID</b> <b>Message Property</b> Specifies whether Message Queue should set the JMS-defined property, JMSXConsumerTXID (transaction identifier 
  of the transaction within which this message was consumed), on consumed messages. 
  Default: false</p>
<p><b>Enable JMSXRcvTimestamp Message Property</b> Specifies whether Message Queue should 
  set the JMS-defined property, JMSXRcvTimestamp (the time the message is delivered 
  to the consumer), on consumed messages. Default: false</p>
