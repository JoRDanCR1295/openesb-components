<H2>Add Connection Factory Object &gt; <BR>
  3.0 Connection Handling</H2>

<p>Use the Connection Handling tab to specify basic information about the connections 
  that will be created by this factory.</p>

<p><b>Connection Type</b> Use the drop list to select the connection type.</p>

<p><b>Broker Host Name</b> Specify the name of the machine hosting the broker 
  to which the client will connect.</p>

<p><b>Broker Host Port</b> Specify the number of the port-mapper port. The client 
  uses the information provided by the port-mapper to connect to the desired service, 
  either jms or ssljms.</p>
<p><b>Broker Service Port</b> Specify the number of the port to use to make a 
  direct connection to the jms or ssljms service. Use Broker Service Port to bypass 
  the port-mapper. This allows clients to connect through firewalls using a single 
  known port.</p>

<p><b>HTTP URL</b> Specify the URL that will be used to connect to the Message 
  Service. By default this is <code>http://localhost/imq/tunnel</code>.</p>
