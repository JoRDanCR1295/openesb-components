#This is the primary operator that is tested
PrimaryOperator: NotificationStream

#This is the operator which gives input to the primary operator
InputOperator: TimeBasedWindow

#Text description of what aspect is being tested, the operator configuration, etc.
#If more than one test exists per cell, use AspectDesc.1, AspectDesc.2, etc

AspectDesc.0: All the allowed data types are used as inputs. In one branch, the TimeBasedWindow has size 5s and the NotificationStream immediately following it also has size of 5s.  This branch should not produce any output. The TimeBasedWindow in the lower branch is larger than the NotificationStream, so it should produce output.
