AspectDesc.0: Testing Stream Project and Filter where different data types are used in an expression, possibly sql code in where clause, then filters for output. Stream Projection and Filter is then linked to Stream Output. Tried where where STimestamp is not null, but failed - not correct syntax?

AspectDesc.1: Stream Projection and Filter passes integer, double, bigint, date, timestamp and varchar; where LastName = 'Chang' or 'Smith'; next operator where double (Income) > 47510.

AspectDesc.2: Stream Projection and Filter passes integer, double, bigint, date, timestamp and varchar; LastName = 'Chang' or 'Smith'; next operator where is empty

AspectDesc.3: Stream Projection and Filter passes integer, double, bigint, date, timestamp and varchar; LastName = 'Chang' or 'Smith'; next operator where LastName <> 'Chang'
