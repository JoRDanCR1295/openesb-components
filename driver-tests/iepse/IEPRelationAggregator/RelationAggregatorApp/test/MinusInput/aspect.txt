AspectDesc.0: Testing Relation Aggregator where different data types are used in an expression, sql code and group by, then calculated for output. Relation Aggregator is then linked to Relation Output and Relation Stream then Stream Output.

AspectDesc.1: Relation Aggregator calculates MIN, MAX, AVG and SUM for bigint; COUNT for STimestamp; no where clause; group by varchar (LastName).

AspectDesc.2: Relation Aggregator calculates MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM and COUNT for integer; MIN and MAX for STimestamp; where LastName = 'Day' or 'Change'; group by varchar (LastName).

AspectDesc.3: Relation Aggregator calculates MIN, MAX, AVG and SUM for double; COUNT for varchar (SDesc); where varchar (SDesc) is not null; group by varchar (LastName).

AspectDesc.4: Relation Aggregator calculates MIN, MAX and COUNT for double and timestamp; where STimestamp is greater than '1999-12-31 00:00:00'; group by varchar (LastName).
