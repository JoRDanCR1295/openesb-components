AspectDesc.0: ContiguousOrder with big as the sort key and another bigint as a partition key. The start value is 9223372036854775801 which is very close to the bigint limit on positive side which is 9223372036854775807. The TupleSerialCorrelation has a size two and increment 1 which means every event will be combined withTwo sets of events are sent in random order, in one set all four events that form a co its next one and sent as a composite event when the next one arrives. The partition keys used are the two extreme ranges from bigint which are 9223372036854775807 and -9223372036854775807.
