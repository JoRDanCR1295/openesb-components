AspectDesc.0: All the allowed data types are used as inputs.Input feed is one by one without any delay. Clob data type is filtered out using Stream Projection And Filter as CLOB data type is not valid.Two relations are created for each Minus using filter and tuple. Then two Minuses are fed into main Minus for this test.
