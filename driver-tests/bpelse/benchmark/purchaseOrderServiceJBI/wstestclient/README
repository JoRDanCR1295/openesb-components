 How to build and run the wsclient
 ---------------------------------

 1. Set JAVA_HOME
 2. Set APPSERVER_HOME - typically this is ${SRCROOT}/Sun\Appserver
 3. Make sure wscompile is in your path - this is an Appserver utility, and can be found in 
    %APPSERVER_HOME%\bin subdirectory.
 4. Make sure that the project WSDL and xsd files are accessible from the root
    directory of this README file.
 5. Run the test builder using batfile buildTest.bat
 6. Run the test driver file with the required number of threads and 
    iterations ; e.g. runTest.bat 10 10 <verifyFlag>
    The verifyFlag should be set to false or true, and will verify the return data is as
    expected for the PurchaseOrder contents and status.

 7. An example run should look like:

	${drivertest_dir}/bpelse\benchmark\purchaseOrderServiceJBI\wstestclient>buildTest.bat
