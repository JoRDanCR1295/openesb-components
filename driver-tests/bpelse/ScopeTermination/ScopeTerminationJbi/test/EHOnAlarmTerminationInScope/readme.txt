This test tests termination of onAlarm in event handlers. The timeout for the test is 10s. If the onAlarm does not get terminated, it would wait for 5 secs and in the FH we wait another 6s. So the reply would come after 11 secs if the onAlarm is not terminated. Also, if the onAlarm is not terminated, the reply following the onAlarm will execute resulting in the test failure.
