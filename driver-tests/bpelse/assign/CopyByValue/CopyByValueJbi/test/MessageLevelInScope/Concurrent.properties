description=testcase MessageLevelInScope\nObjective: Not to create copy for Assign7 as all the referencing scope variables for scope1 should be dereferenced and also the other process level variable (b) before assign7.\nNote: This test is created to do white box testing as it is not possible to verify this bust by the output comparison as the result would be same even if we do excessive copy.
