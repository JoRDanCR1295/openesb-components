Encoding provides the ability to encode(compress) and decode(decompress) data
utilizing the Encoding API and Implementation(s) from the Gestalt repository.
The Encoding Component uses attachments instead of content to set the
encoded data. However the decoded data (original XML decoded) is
set back in content.
